      "description": "Self-discipline means living your life the hard way: resisting temptations and instant gratification, in\norder to receive bigger and better rewards in the future. It’s certainly easier to avoid all kinds of\ndiscomfort and indulge yourself whenever you want, but in the end, all that you get from that approach is\nfleeting pleasure now at the expense of your future, which otherwise could have been much better.\nConsider a weak-willed person who, when faced with a challenge, immediately opts out. How likely\nis this person to achieve anything substantial in life if their primary value is to feel comfortable? How is\nthis person going to manage a crisis that they must face? Even a relatively insignificant problem can\nbecome an insurmountable obstacle for a person who’s been living a sheltered life and always avoided\nwhat’s difficult or disagreeable.\nNow contrast that with a person who voluntarily makes his or her life harder. They seek out and\nwelcome challenges as opportunities to grow. Each self-imposed affliction strengthens them, so that fewer\nand fewer difficulties in life overwhelm them. Day by day, they immunize themselves against problems,\nprecisely because they seek them out. When life deals them an unexpected blow, they’re ready to handle it\nbecause — thanks to living their lives the hard way — they’re always ready for hardships.",

      "description": "Humans have the capacity to act against their urges in exchange for a better future. Unfortunately,\nmany people live by the principle of “if it feels good, do it, and if it doesn’t, don’t do it.”\nCaving in to your temptations whenever you feel them emerge is like relinquishing your humanity, in\na way. As an intelligent human being, you have an ability — and I daresay an obligation — to make\ndecisions that are based on rational thinking, not on your instincts alone.\nStrive to be a better human and embrace your humanity by exercising your “willpower muscle,”\ninstead of succumbing to your most primal (and least helpful for your long-term goals) part of the brain.\nYour most primal instincts may provide temporary comfort, but seldom are good for the long term, except\nwhen there is a direct threat to your survival.",

      "description": "No matter how self-disciplined you are, there’s no escaping the fact that sometimes you’ll stumble.\nPerhaps you’ll eat a piece of a cake instead of a salad. Maybe you’ll skip a workout out of laziness. It’s\npossible that when your efforts result in a failure, you’ll lose the self-discipline to continue and revert\nback to your old undesirable habits.\nIt’s all par for the course, and the sooner you accept, it, the easier it will be to handle the setbacks\nonce they occur. However, don’t consider your failures a useless waste of time and energy; a failure can\noften present new opportunities or lead to important realizations.\nI failed to learn how to play tennis despite putting considerable amount of time, energy, and money\ninto it. However, this made me realize that I wanted to concentrate on rock climbing, and the failure with\ntennis cleared the way for dramatic improvements in my climbing performance.\nWhen discouraged, remember that all struggles present opportunities that, given enough time, you can\nconvert into successes or lessons that will aid you in other areas of life.",
